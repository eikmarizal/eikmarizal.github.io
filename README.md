# Type of Machine Learning Algorithms
- Supervised Learning (From a target (dependent variable) to be predicted from given set of predictors (independent variables)
- Unsupervised Learning (No target (dependent variable) usually used for clustering)
- Reinforcement Learning (Machine is trained to make decisions based on algorithm to learn from previous experience)

# TERMINOLOGY
- Supervised Machine Learning- Combining input from learning to produce useful predictions on unseen data
- Label- For example in spam filtering labels could be spam or not spam (target taht we want to predict)
- Features- Way we present the data
- Label example- Has {features, label}:(x,y) used in training
- Unlabeled example- has {features, no label}:(x,y) used in testing
- Model- learned by mapping example to predicted label

# List of Machine Learning Algorithms (Examples)
## Linear Regression
Finding straight line or hyperplane that best fits to set of points
## Logistic Regression
## Decision Tree
## SVM
## Naive Bayes
## kNN
## K-Means
## Random Forest
## Dimension Reduction Algorithm
## Gradient Boosting Algorithms:
- GBM
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

## Reducing loss
As we train a model reducing loss will give best trained model. Stochastic Gradient Descent involves one example at a time while for Mini-Batch Gradient Descent batches 10-1000

## Type of Training models
- Static model- traine offline and exactly once
- Dynamic model- trained online and through continuous updates

## K-Means clustering
K-Mean clustering use a method of vector quantization for (cluster analysis). Cluster analysis is where grouping task is among similarity to each other for same group.

## Steps in K-Means
- Choose K centroids (K rows randomly select)
- Assigns every data point to its closest centroid
- Recalculate the average/mean of all data points in a cluster of centroid
- Assign data points to theirs closest centroids
