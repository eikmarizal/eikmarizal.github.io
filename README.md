# TERMINOLOGY
#### Supervised Machine Learning- Combining input from learning to produce useful predictions on unseen data
#### Label- For example in spam filtering labels could be spam or not spam (target taht we want to predict)
#### Features- Way we present the data
#### Label example- Has {features, label}:(x,y) used in training
#### Unlabeled example- has {features, no label}:(x,y) used in testing
#### Model- learned by mapping example to predicted label

# Example
## Linear Regression
Finding straight line or hyperplane that best fits to set of points

## K-Means clustering
K-Mean clustering use a method of vector quantization for (cluster analysis). Cluster analysis is where grouping task is among similarity to each other for same group.

## Steps in K-Means
- Choose K centroids (K rows randomly select)
- Assigns every data point to its closest centroid
- Recalculate the average/mean of all data points in a cluster of centroid
- Assign data points to theirs closest centroids
