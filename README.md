## K-Means clustering
K-Mean clustering use a method of vector quantization for (cluster analysis). Cluster analysis is where grouping task is among similarity to each other for same group.

## Steps in K-Means
- Choose K centroids (K rows randomly select)
- Assigns every data point to its closest centroid
- Recalculate the average/mean of all data points in a cluster of centroid
- Assign data points to theirs closest centroids
